<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Bootstrap, Axios</p>

<h3>📝 Project Overview</h3>
<p>This full-stack web application was developed as part of the <em>Web and Mobile Application Development</em> course in my undergraduate studies. It allows users to manage an online book collection, supporting CRUD operations and dynamic UI updates.</p>

<h3>🔍 Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Book List Display:</strong> View a complete list of books with author, publication year, subject, and format.</li>
  <li><strong>Add New Books:</strong> Users can easily add new books through a simple and intuitive form UI.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit & Delete:</strong> Edit or delete any record instantly using client-side controls.</li>
  <li><strong>Search by Topic:</strong> Browse books based on subject-specific categories for efficient discovery.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Built using Bootstrap for consistent user experience across all screen sizes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>⚙️ Architecture</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js with Express handles RESTful APIs, MongoDB for data storage, and Mongoose for schema modeling.</li>
  <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Built with React to ensure fast rendering and stateful interactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Axios:</strong> Used for seamless HTTP communication between the frontend and backend layers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🎯 Outcome</h3>
<p>This project demonstrated my understanding of full-stack architecture, RESTful API development, UI/UX principles, and component-based frontend engineering using React.</p>
